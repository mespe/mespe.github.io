      <title>A few things I don&#39;t love about Stan</title>

      <description>First off, I love Stan. If you have not heard of Stan, I highly recommend you check it out. I use Stan for almost all of my statistics these days, and have published several papers using it.
That said, there are a fair number of things I don&amp;rsquo;t like about it:
The model trade-offs In my experience, when you are developing a model in Stan, you are often faced with trade-offs between 1) flexibility, 2) readability, and 3) development time.</description>

      <title>Moving past p-values</title>

      <description>I had a marathon review/revision session with my adviser last week regarding a manuscript I am working on - overall took 2 hours!
We were going round and round in circles, and finally 1.25 hours in we got to the piece of my paper that was really bugging my advisor: I did not have a single p-value in the entire paper. What followed was a really interesting exchange that I think highlights some of the issues that are behind scientific research, especially in agriculture, using out-of-date statistics.</description>

      <description>Here is a collection of my published and unpublished work.
Publications Agriculture Rice yield improvements by through plant breeding are offset by inherent yield decreases declines over time. In prep. 2017.
Point stresses during reproductive stage rather than warming seasonal temperature determine yield in temperate rice. Glob Change Biol. 2017;00:1–10.
Variation in yield, starch, and protein of dry peas grown across Montana. Agronomy Journal, In Press, 2017
Yield gap analysis of US rice production systems shows opportunities for improvement.</description>

      <title>Creating an R blog with Hugo (without using blogdown)</title>

      <description>I thought I would write up my experiences starting a blog that uses R code but that does not use blogdown. Why do I not use blogdown? The short story is that blogdown does not seem quite ready to use, as it is missing some elements to make publishing a blog easy.
The long story is that after spending a good chunk of time helping a student navigate through using blogdown, I found the approach below to be both easier to use and simpler to implement.</description>

      <description>I am an agronomist by training (dealing with all things agriculture), with an emphasis in the yield of major crops. I am particularly interested in the historic causes of yield variability to inform efforts to feed our growing population with increasingly limited resources.
But I wear many hats. I am also a data scientist, with a focus on increasing capability of researchers to expand their capabilities. In this role, I develop new tools and teach people existing tools and data skillsets.</description>

      <description>Hello World!
This is my first post to test out Hugo. Overall, it was a bit of a pain to set up with github personal pages. Oh well, it seems to be working now.</description>
