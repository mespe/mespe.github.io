Certainly less than ideal, but I was just happy to be going home at that point.
The next day I dutifully made the appointment with my primary care doctor, which lead to a referral for a CT scan of my abdomen and a consult with a surgeon. My doctor said it was all precautionary &amp;ndash; he just wanted the images and consult with the surgeon in case the pain returned.</description></item><item><title>The tummy ache</title><link>https://mespe.github.io/post/the_beginning/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jun 2022 15:33:25 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://mespe.github.io/post/the_beginning/</guid><description>About two months ago, I had a horrible tummy ache.

I originally envisioned this space as being primarily for more professional posts - data science, stats, sciencey stuff. But then I started co-authoring a book, and many of those thoughts were being put into the book. Or I found myself without the time to write new posts.
But I have lots I have wanted to write about, topics which are not data science, stats, sciencey stuff.</description></item></channel></rss>
