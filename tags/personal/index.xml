For months and months I have not had much to write about&amp;hellip; well, that&amp;rsquo;s not exactly true. I originally envisioned this space as being primarily for more professional posts - data science, stats, sciencey stuff. But then I started co-authoring a book, and many of those thoughts were being put into the book. Or I found myself without the time to write new posts.
But I have lots I have wanted to write about, topics which are not data science, stats, sciencey stuff.</description></item></channel></rss>
