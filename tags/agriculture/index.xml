One of the most common questions that comes up in scientific publications is &amp;ldquo;Can I trust these conclusions?&amp;rdquo; Statistics is supposed to help us decide the weight of evidence for or against a certain conclusion, but there have been issues. We are realizing that the standard paradim is not holding up, and there are many more false positives in the literature than the p &amp;lt; 0.</description></item><item><title>What I'm up to</title><link>https://mespe.github.io/post/update_nov30_2017/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Nov 2017 21:39:27 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://mespe.github.io/post/update_nov30_2017/</guid><description>I have been a bit quiet, mostly due to the holidays and general busyness. While I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything ready to go, there are some fun things coming down the line:
1. I have been converting the CA-Rice physiological model to Go.
Why this model? I reached out to Bard Miller, and he was kind enough to send the source code. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the code was simple, well-organized, and generally easy to make sense of.</description></item><item><title>What I study</title><link>https://mespe.github.io/research/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2017 18:17:59 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://mespe.github.io/research/</guid><description>Here is a collection of my published and unpublished work.
