There are many different ways to get to that goal. Here, I am going to talk through how I determined what path to take.
Processor This is probably the biggest determinate for the rest of the system, as it will dictate some of the other components.</description></item><item><title>Workstation Update</title><link>https://mespe.github.io/post/workstation_update/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2020 14:27:08 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://mespe.github.io/post/workstation_update/</guid><description>Way back in 2017, I built a cheap data science rig for $600. You can read about the build here. Since that post, I added a mid-tier NVIDIA GPU for machine learning, and some hard drives for more storage. Otherwise, it&amp;rsquo;s been pretty bullet-proof for the last 3 years.
While it was a great solution for what needed at the time, eventually it&amp;rsquo;s shortcomings were increasingly obvious. Those were:
Efficiency (or lack there of): 16 cores of 2012-circa Xeon processors pulled roughly 200W on their own.</description></item><item><title>I blame Apple</title><link>https://mespe.github.io/post/keyboards/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2017 20:37:46 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://mespe.github.io/post/keyboards/</guid><description>I am a bit particular about keyboards. I find the keyboards on most computers to be trash, whether it&amp;rsquo;s a laptop or desktop. This has lead to our house having 3 quality mechanical keyboards, despite having only one desktop and one docking station (the odd one out, a classic 90&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;clicky&amp;rdquo; keyboard, was politely banned from our work space). This is also a reason I enjoy Lenovo laptops, as they tend to have better keyboards than most.</description></item><item><title>Data science on the cheap - pt. 3</title><link>https://mespe.github.io/post/cheap3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Oct 2017 16:33:23 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://mespe.github.io/post/cheap3/</guid><description>This is the last part of the series, and if you have not read the other two parts(pt. 1,pt. 2), it might be helpful to glance back to see how I got here.
In the last part, I explained the thinking that led me to build my own workstation using reclaimed parts. Here is brief overview of what I did:

If you have no experience assembling a computer system, please find a beginner&amp;rsquo;s guide for the basics.</description></item><item><title>Data science on the cheap - pt. 2</title><link>https://mespe.github.io/post/cheap2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Oct 2017 17:09:12 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://mespe.github.io/post/cheap2/</guid><description>This is the continuation of Data Science on the Cheap, where I discussed the potential to use a Chromebook as a cheap entry to data science. After trying the main configurations, I concluded that the easiest use case was to use the Chromebook as a cheap and portable terminal to access a bigger machine elsewhere. But that leaves you with only half of the equation - you still need the other machine.</description></item><item><title>Data science on the cheap</title><link>https://mespe.github.io/post/cheap_datasci/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2017 19:46:04 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://mespe.github.io/post/cheap_datasci/</guid><description>One thing you will notice pretty quick if you hang around data-sci folks is they tend to pack pretty spendy hardware. During workshops, it is not uncommon for our classroom at the UC Davis Data Science Initiative to be packed full of Macbook Pros and other $1K+ laptops.
Recently my daily driver (Lenovo T460s) needed to go into the shop for a little work, which gave me a chance to play with my backup - a Lenovo Yoga 11e Chromebook, which I picked up for $160 shipped.</description></item></channel></rss>
