You can read about the build here. Since that post, I added a mid-tier NVIDIA GPU for machine learning, and some hard drives for more storage. Otherwise, it&amp;rsquo;s been pretty bullet-proof for the last 3 years.
While it was a great solution for what needed at the time, eventually it&amp;rsquo;s shortcomings were increasingly obvious. Those were:
Efficiency (or lack there of): 16 cores of 2012-circa Xeon processors pulled roughly 200W on their own.</description></item><item><title>Future of R (per Hadley)</title><link>https://mespe.github.io/post/future_of_r/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2019 10:03:30 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://mespe.github.io/post/future_of_r/</guid><description>Quartz had a pretty interesting interview with Hadley Wickham on the Future of R. While the interview was pretty short, it has many interesting tidbits about how Hadley thinks about R.
The problem with the future of R according to the tidyverse and RStudio Many of the tidyverse developers are employed by RStudio, a commercial company. It is, in many ways, strange to be asking an employee of a commercial company about the future of an open source software.</description></item><item><title>Data Science Minimalism</title><link>https://mespe.github.io/post/datasci_minimalism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2019 11:42:51 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://mespe.github.io/post/datasci_minimalism/</guid><description>When I got my first taste of data science, it was intoxicating. With a few lines of code, I could visualize and explore data and make some inferences. I was drawn to data science by the possibilities it represented. The data science toolbox represented a key to unraveling the data I found all around me. Learning how to use these tools was exciting and made me feel powerful and capable.</description></item><item><title>Why workshops are tough to teach</title><link>https://mespe.github.io/post/workshops/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2019 09:39:47 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://mespe.github.io/post/workshops/</guid><description>A couple of weeks ago, I taught a one-hour workshop on the basics of writing functions in R. Overall, it went as well as I would expect an hour introduction workshop to go, which is to say OK but not great. Why not great? It turns out teaching skills in workshops is really difficult. But why?
I think it boils down to a couple of aspects of workshops:
Workshops:
are too short teach to the lowest skill level in the room don&amp;rsquo;t reflect how you actually learn these skill 1.</description></item><item><title>Consulting</title><link>https://mespe.github.io/consulting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Sep 2018 16:43:02 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://mespe.github.io/consulting/</guid><description>Need help with something?

There are good reasons, which will be explained in coming posts. Stay tuned.
A brief intro to dynamic documents in R (cont.) Last time I outlined why you might want to use a dynamic document, and some of the popular formates that are commonly used. There are many great resources for the syntax used to actually create dynamic documents (e.g., for Rmarkdown: Rstudio, R-bloggers, etc.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Docs in R (part 1)</title><link>https://mespe.github.io/post/dyn_docs-pt1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Mar 2018 11:14:04 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://mespe.github.io/post/dyn_docs-pt1/</guid><description>A brief intro to dynamic documents in R I was asked to give a short overview of dynamic documents in R during Dr. Cini Brown&amp;rsquo;s lab meeting at Colorado State University last week, and I thought I would post some of the material here as well.
What is a dynamic document? Dynamic documents, or living documents, are documents which can be continuously updated, and are often self-contained. This means that the document itself contains the framework to generate and update its content.</description></item><item><title>What I'm up to</title><link>https://mespe.github.io/post/update_nov30_2017/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Nov 2017 21:39:27 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://mespe.github.io/post/update_nov30_2017/</guid><description>I have been a bit quiet, mostly due to the holidays and general busyness. While I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything ready to go, there are some fun things coming down the line:
1. I have been converting the CA-Rice physiological model to Go.
Why this model? I reached out to Bard Miller, and he was kind enough to send the source code. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the code was simple, well-organized, and generally easy to make sense of.</description></item><item><title>Data science on the cheap - pt. 3</title><link>https://mespe.github.io/post/cheap3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Oct 2017 16:33:23 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://mespe.github.io/post/cheap3/</guid><description>This is the last part of the series, and if you have not read the other two parts(pt. 1,pt. 2), it might be helpful to glance back to see how I got here.
In the last part, I explained the thinking that led me to build my own workstation using reclaimed parts. Here is brief overview of what I did:

After trying the main configurations, I concluded that the easiest use case was to use the Chromebook as a cheap and portable terminal to access a bigger machine elsewhere. But that leaves you with only half of the equation - you still need the other machine.</description></item><item><title>Data science on the cheap</title><link>https://mespe.github.io/post/cheap_datasci/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2017 19:46:04 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://mespe.github.io/post/cheap_datasci/</guid><description>One thing you will notice pretty quick if you hang around data-sci folks is they tend to pack pretty spendy hardware. During workshops, it is not uncommon for our classroom at the UC Davis Data Science Initiative to be packed full of Macbook Pros and other $1K+ laptops.
Recently my daily driver (Lenovo T460s) needed to go into the shop for a little work, which gave me a chance to play with my backup - a Lenovo Yoga 11e Chromebook, which I picked up for $160 shipped.</description></item><item><title>What I study</title><link>https://mespe.github.io/research/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jun 2017 18:17:59 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://mespe.github.io/research/</guid><description>Here is a collection of my published and unpublished work.
