      <title>Dynamic Docs in R (part 1)</title>

      <description>A brief intro to dynamic documents in R I was asked to give a short overview of dynamic documents in R during Dr. Cini Brown&amp;rsquo;s lab meeting at Colorado State University last week, and I thought I bring some of the material as well.
What is a dynamic document? Dynamic documents, or living documents, are documents which can be continuously updated, and are often self-contained. This means that the document itself contains the framework to generate and update its content.</description>

      <description>I have been a bit quiet, mostly due to the holidays and general busyness. While I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything ready to go, there are some fun things coming down the line:
1. I have been converting the CA-Rice physiological model to Go.
Why this model? I reached out to Bard Miller, and he was kind enough to send the source code. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the code was simple, well-organized, and generally easy to make sense of.</description>

      <description>This is the last part of the series, and if you have not read the other two parts(pt. 1,pt. 2), it might be helpful to glance back to see how I got here.
In the last part, I explained the thinking that led me to build my own workstation using reclaimed parts. Here is brief overview of what I did:

      <description>This is the continuation of Data Science on the Cheap, where I discussed the potential to use a Chromebook as a cheap entry to data science. After trying the main configurations, I concluded that the easiest use case was to use the Chromebook as a cheap and portable terminal to access a bigger machine elsewhere. But that leaves you with only half of the equation - you still need the other machine.</description>

      <description>One thing you will notice pretty quick if you hang around data-sci folks is they tend to pack pretty spendy hardware. During workshops, it is not uncommon for our classroom at the UC Davis Data Science Initiative to be packed full of Macbook Pros and other $1K+ laptops.
Recently my daily driver (Lenovo T460s) needed to go into the shop for a little work, which gave me a chance to play with my backup - a Lenovo Yoga 11e Chromebook, which I picked up for $160 shipped.</description>

      <title>A few things I don&#39;t love about Stan</title>

      <description>First off, I love Stan. If you have not heard of Stan, I highly recommend you check it out. I use Stan for almost all of my statistics these days, and have published several papers using it.
That said, there are a fair number of things I don&amp;rsquo;t like about it:
The model trade-offs In my experience, when you are developing a model in Stan, you are often faced with trade-offs between 1) flexibility, 2) readability, and 3) development time.</description>
