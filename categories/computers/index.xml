      <description>I am a bit particular about keyboards. I find the keyboards on most computers to be trash, whether it&amp;rsquo;s a laptop or desktop. This has lead to our house having 3 quality mechanical keyboards, despite having only one desktop and one docking station (the odd one out, a classic 90&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;clicky&amp;rdquo; keyboard, was politely banned from our work space). This is also a reason I enjoy Lenovo laptops, as they tend to have better keyboards than most.</description>

      <description>This is the continuation of Data Science on the Cheap, where I discussed the potential to use a Chromebook as a cheap entry to data science. After trying the main configurations, I concluded that the easiest use case was to use the Chromebook as a cheap and portable terminal to access a bigger machine elsewhere. But that leaves you with only half of the equation - you still need the other machine.</description>
