One of the most common questions that comes up in scientific publications is &amp;ldquo;Can I trust these conclusions?&amp;rdquo; Statistics is supposed to help us decide the weight of evidence for or against a certain conclusion, but there have been issues.

While I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything ready to go, there are some fun things coming down the line:
1. I have been converting the CA-Rice physiological model to Go.
Why this model? I reached out to Bard Miller, and he was kind enough to send the source code. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the code was simple, well-organized, and generally easy to make sense of.</description></item><item><title>Forecasting famine during a food glut</title><link>https://mespe.github.io/post/food_glut/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2017 21:00:27 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://mespe.github.io/post/food_glut/</guid><description>Reuters just released a special story about the historic levels of food stocks, and the associated drop in agricultural profits, both at the farm and the farm services level. This is interesting to me because almost all of the papers I have written and the research I have done has been motivated by the need to produce more food to feed the growing population. Many influential papers in agriculture have highlighted the coming food shortages, the need to double food production by 2050, etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
