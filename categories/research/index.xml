      <description>I had a marathon review/revision session with my adviser last week regarding a manuscript I am working on - overall took 2 hours!
We were going round and round in circles, and finally 1.25 hours in we got to the piece of my paper that was really bugging my advisor: I did not have a single p-value in the entire paper. What followed was a really interesting exchange that I think highlights some of the issues that are behind scientific research, especially in agriculture, using out-of-date statistics.</description>
