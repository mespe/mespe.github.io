      <description>I thought I would write up my experiences starting a blog that uses R code but that does not use blogdown. Why do I not use blogdown? The short story is that blogdown does not seem quite ready to use, as it is missing some elements to make publishing a blog easy.
The long story is that after spending a good chunk of time helping a student navigate through using blogdown, I found the approach below to be both easier to use and simpler to implement.</description>

      <description>Hello World!
This is my first post to test out Hugo. Overall, it was a bit of a pain to set up with github personal pages. Oh well, it seems to be working now.</description>
