      <description>I had a marathon review/revision session with my adviser last week regarding a manuscript I am working on - overall took 2 hours!
We were going round and round in circles, and finally 1.25 hours in we got to the piece of my paper that was really bugging my advisor: I did not have a single p-value in the entire paper. What followed was a really interesting exchange that I think highlights some of the issues that are behind scientific research, especially in agriculture, using out-of-date statistics.</description>

      <title>Creating an R blog with Hugo (without using blogdown)</title>

      <description>I thought I would write up my experiences starting a blog that uses R code but that does not use blogdown. Why do I not use blogdown? The short story is that blogdown does not seem quite ready to use, as it is missing some elements to make publishing a blog easy.
The long story is that after spending a good chunk of time helping a student navigate through using blogdown, I found the approach below to be both easier to use and simpler to implement.</description>

      <description>Hello World!
This is my first post to test out Hugo. Overall, it was a bit of a pain to set up with github personal pages. Oh well, it seems to be working now.</description>
