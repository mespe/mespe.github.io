After eight hours in the ED, I was sent home with no diagnostic
evidence as to what had caused the stomach ache. Certainly less than
ideal, but I was just happy to be going home at that point.

The next day I dutifully made the appointment with my primary care
doctor, which lead to a referral for a CT scan of my abdomen and a
consult with a surgeon. My doctor said it was all precautionary -- he
just wanted the images and consult with the surgeon in case the pain
returned. 

If the pain returned, the remedy is to remove the gallbladder. It made
sense to talk to a surgeon now so he was familiar with my
case. Actually removing the gallbladder, however, was no something I
was ready to sign off on just yet. Seemed a bit aggressive to remove
an organ without proof it was the cause.

You see, I had been warned that surgeons like to do surgery, and will
often recommend it as the first course of action. I had several
inconclusive scans at this point -- hardly sufficient evidence for
removing an organ. So, as I walked into the surgeons office, I was
prepared to push back on removing my gallbladder.

Hence, the first thing the surgeon said came as no surprise:

> "Oh, yeah, the gallbladder needs to come out."

What came next blindsided me:

> "But the gallbladder's the secondary concern - this other mass. That's
> more pressing... It's most likely a tumor."

I like to think of myself as a rational person, but in this moment I
switched into panic mode. 

Tumor... does that mean cancer?

How did this
happen? I am young, healthy... 

My thoughts spiraled. I felt panic creeping in. I wasn't really
listening to the surgeon as he sketched a little diagram.

Three. Two. One... It was too much, and rational brain took back the
reins. I took a deep breath. And then I got to work.

Suddenly this was a just another project to manage - like a study or
piece of software. I took a quick inventory of what needed to happen,
then asked the surgeon about next steps, time-lines, risks. No panic,
no real emotion. Just another project. I asked direct questions, took
notes, developed a plan.

I was told it was urgent to deal with ASAP before it continued to
develop. The surgeon tried to get me an appointment for a biopsy as I
waited in his office. The GI specialist was out, so I was told to call
first thing the following day. The surgeon explained they might
proceed with surgery without if the biopsy could not be scheduled in
time. The goal was to have surgery within a few weeks, a month
tops. The surgery would be simple - like "playing Xbox" the surgeon
said.

Oh, and they would remove my gallbladder at the same time. I didn't
have the energy to push back. Deal with it later.

Before I left, I reviewed the time-line with the surgeon. I asked if it
needed to be fully resolved on the order of weeks or months. He
responded weeks - I should have this thing removed within a month at
most.

I left the office with notes in hand for the next steps. I needed to
get a biopsy ASAP. I needed to schedule surgery right after
that. Thankfully, rational brain was still in charge.

But right behind it, panic. Behind the orderly notes and planning was
the words the surgeon said...

ASAP. Urgent. 

I took a breath, and called my wife...
