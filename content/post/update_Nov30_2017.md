I have been a bit quiet, mostly due to the holidays and general
busyness. While I don't have anything ready to go, there are some fun
things coming down the line:

**1. I have been converting the [CA-Rice physiological model](https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/aj/abstracts/85/4/AJ0850040938?access=0&view=pdf)
   to [Go](golang.org).**
	   
Why this model? I reached out to Bard Miller,
and he was kind enough to send the source code. I was
pleasantly surprised to find that the code was simple,
well-organized, and generally easy to make sense of. In the world
of researcher created code, this is pretty rare. Second, it was
created for CA rice, so there is a very good chance that it will
handle conditions here better than the models written for tropical
conditions (e.g., ORYZA). It would be a waste for all the original
work to rot away on a floppy disk (yes, a 5" floppy).
	
Why Go? It is a fun language that I have been wanting to learn
better. As I often tell my students, you cannot learn a programming
language by listening/reading about it. You actually need to work
through a real problem. I have ambitious plans for this model, ones
that Go is well suited for.
   
Where is it? Currently on a private repo. The model runs perfectly,
but I have big plans - retrieving data from remote sources,
forecasting with uncertainty, etc. Before I make it public, I want
to make sure the original authors are OK with this use.
   
**2. I also have been making dynamic data visualizations using
[D3](d3js.org).**

Why? Cause they are cool, and while I love R, the
rest of the world is working off a web browser. You can make some
cool visualizations using tools such as
[plotly](https://plot.ly/r/), but I always run into the limitations
of these tools. I am much more comfortable working with more basic
building blocks.

**3. Some webscraping and an analytics dashboard**
   
Top secret. :P

**4. Beyond that, I am writing writing writing...**

I have 3 papers in the works that need to go out yesterday.
   
Stay tuned. Some cool stuff is in the works.
