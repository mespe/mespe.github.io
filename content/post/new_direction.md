Hello, long neglected blog!

For months and months I have not had much to write about... well,
that's not exactly true. I originally envisioned this space as being
primarily for more professional posts - data science, stats, sciencey
stuff. But then I started co-authoring a book, and many of those
thoughts were being put into the book. Or I found myself without the
time to write new posts.  

But I have lots I have wanted to write about, topics which are not
data science, stats, sciencey stuff. Some of that will go here
starting now. Expect stories of recent experiences, as well as my
other interests away from the keyboard.

More soon...
