Reuters just released a special story about the [historic levels of
food
storage](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-grains-supply-special-report/special-report-drowning-in-grain-how-big-ag-sowed-seeds-of-a-profit-slashing-glut-idUSKCN1C21AR?utm_source=Facebook&utm_medium=Social),
and the associated drop in agriculture sector profits, both at the
farm and the farm services level. This is interesting to me because
almost all of the papers I have written and the research I have done
has been motivated by the need to produce more food to feed the
growing population.
