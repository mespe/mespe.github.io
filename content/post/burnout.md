*This is primarily written for me as a way to organize my thoughts - 
If you are not me and are reading this, I decided that something below was possibly useful to someone else.
But please be aware that this was not intended for anyone other than myself.*

For the last few months, I have been struggling with burnout. 
It took me a little while to even recognize what was going on. 
My motivation for work slipped, slowly culminating to the point where I was struggling to even finish simple tasks.

Burnout is nothing new for academics or people who code. 
[HackerNews routinely has posts on burnout.](https://hn.algolia.com/?query=burnout&sort=byPopularity&prefix&page=0&dateRange=all&type=story)
This post is my somewhat feable attempt to collect my thoughts from the last few months.

## What burnout looked like for me

As I said previously, burnout crept in slowly over the course of several months.
I noticed that I was getting less and less done, despite putting in more hours.
In normal circumstances, I pride myself on my productivity. 
During my PhD, I was productive. 
Several people have assumed I was a junior professor after glancing at my publication list and CV.
Interestingly, I did not really experience burnout during my PhD itself - for me it all started during my Post-Doc appointment.

During my Post-doc, I found myself becoming increasingly unproductive.
More and more of my day was being spent trying to get organized and motivated to tackle a project.
Even though I found the work interesting, I was losing focus and drive to do it.

## What started it all: Taking on too much

In reflecting over the last few months, I have come to believe that taking on more projects than our research group could handle sustainably is probably the original sin here.
Almost all of the following are in some way directly decended from the decision to take on more projects than we would actually be able to handle in a sustainable manner.
There were some strategic reasons why this happened (I have heard) - I don't know if the end result was worth it.

While I was productive during my PhD, I kept my projects to the low single digits.
I had a lot of variety in the things I took on, and I was careful not to commit to anything that I was not interested in.
My side projects were limited to those I really cared about.
That is not to say that there were not times when the wheels fell off the bus, but those times were the exception.

The following are some lessons I have learned from this experience:

### If everything is a priority, then nothing is

One issue with taking on too many projects when you have limited resources is that something has to give.
To be sustainable, some projects had to be given higher priority. 
Resources have to come from somewhere. 
However, it is tempting to try to make everything important. 
But nothing is free, so the costs come from somewhere else.

For roughly a year, standard operating procedure at my Post-doc was that project X was high priority and needed to be finished yesterday.
So, I would work nights and weekends to get it finished.
But as soon as it was finished, there were 10 other projects which were also high priority.
Every day was spent as a panicked rush to complete something, only to wake up and do it all over again.
At its worst, I would sit down to plan my day only to struggle to figure out which of the plethera of projects should actually take priority.
When everything was urgent, I literally could not decide what needed to be done first. 
Hence, in the end, nothing took priority.

### The cost of context switching

One issue that I alluded to above was that context switching, the act of switching from one thing to another, has a cost.
Unfortunately, many people believe that they are great multi-taskers. 
I was once one of them.
During my PhD, I found real value in having varied projects to work on during the same time period.
It allowed me to remain productive, even when I hit a wall with one project.

The trouble with context switching, no matter how helpful, is that it comes with a cost. 
It takes time to get back up to speed with a project, from figuring out what the current status the project is to retooling the workflow to fit the project.
When you do it too often, this time cost can easily eclipse the time actually working on a project.
At worst, it can lead to "paralysis" where you cannot figure out what needs to be done next.

### Nothing is done well last minute

One of the worst habits that PhD's learn during their degree program is rooted in the mistaken belief that you can do many things well last minute and half-assed.
It is commonplace to hear PhD's preparing their talk minutes beforehand, completing their slides on the flight to the conference, "winging" their lecture, etc.
Universally, PhD's learn to some degree that they are clever enough to pull off last minute prep.

Except it is universally true that this last minute work does not represent their best work.
It is almost always "good enough" but never great.

### Execution trumps good ideas

Thing PhDs almost universily learn is the ability to sit in a room and come up with brilliant ideas. 
I have sat in "brainstorming" sessions for hours which resulted in tons of great ideas, only to witness not a single one be implemented. 
The truth is that it is difficult to do things, especially great or brilliant things.
It takes time, resources, and commitment.
Unfortunately, as we piled up projects driven by the potential we saw in them, we spent more and more time coming up with good ideas and less and less time actually making those ideas reality.

### Confusing quantity with quality

Academia rewards people for doing a lot of things. 
I learned this firsthand when I sat on a hiring committee as the graduate student rep.
The first stage consisted of ranking the candidates according to publication quantity, and those below a threshold were disqualified.
The quality of those publications was not considered until much later. 
Some candidates with poor quality work made it further in the process than those with better work.

However, at a certain point, poor quality work cannot be overcome with higher quantity.

### Sometimes, what is useful is not clever, what is clever is not useful
