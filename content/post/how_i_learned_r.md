My path to learning R started the same as many people's - with a book,
alone, in a room. In this case, the books I was using were ones I
found online, likely whatever came up first in a search of "how to
learn R." With great passion, I set to work going through the
books, page by page, chapter by chapter. I wrote out all the code,
tried all the examples, and just generally tried really hard. No one
told me how to program, so I just did what seemed right. At some
point, someone told me about this great program called RStudio, and
using it I felt really powerful.

At some point, I took a couple graduate-level statistics classes which
used R. These classes followed the typical pattern of "Here is a
script we wrote for this analysis. Edit lines X through Y for your
homework." Unlike many of my classmates, I had seen R before. I felt
like the expert in the room, because I already knew how to load
data. I used `attach` with great results. People asked me for help. It
was great.

And then, my path to learning R took a turn that is atypical. I heard
about a class being offered through the statistics department -
"Statistical Computing." It was not really intended for people like
me, a plant scientist, but it had a reputation for really teaching you
R. On a whim, I signed up.

The instructor was a funny, middle aged man with a strange accent -
full of energy, but a bit scattered. He did not use RStudio (which, I
had been told was THE only way to use R productively) and instead was
flying around in something called "Emacs". And fly around he did,
moving quickly from idea to idea, often interrupting himself with
tangents that turned into a full-fledged exploration's about some
detail of the R's computational model.

Then one day, he said something along the lines of "this works this
way because we decided ... " and my brain hit a mental
speed bump. Turns out this unassuming man as a member of R
Core. Without knowing it, I was sitting at the feet of a master.

That class was brutal for me. Not because the instructor, Duncan
Temple Lang, was a jerk - far from it. I have rarely met a person more
willing to give his time and expertise to anyone interested to
learn. No, instead I had to unlearn all the bad habits I learned
previously. Turns out that that using `attach` was typically a bad
idea. So was copying and pasting large amounts of code. So was... the
list went on and on.

These early days of re-learning R were frustrating for me. I went from
the expert in the room to decidely not the expert. I had to learn a little
humility. Many of the questions I asked were not answered directly,
but instead met with a series of questions like "What does that
function take?", "What is that object's structure? Its class?", "Have
you read the help file?", and my least favorite "Did you already look
for an answer on R-help/StackOverflow?" I just wanted the solution,
and it felt like I was getting the run-around. Every beginner knows
the pain of being told to "Read the Docs" in response to questions.  

But then a funny thing happened - before I knew it, I was doing those
things without even thinking about it. Soon, I ditched RStudio as too
limiting and added more tricks to my toolbox of self-sufficient
solutions, and my understanding of the language and my ability to
reason about what it was doing expanded with each step. At some point,
I was using R's debugging and profiling tools without a second
thought. Only years later did I realize how much better off I was for
not getting easy answers while I was learning, or rather re-learning, R.

During this time, I was surrounded by a community of incredibly
skilled, passionate, and generous R users. I did not experience toxic
flaming. I did not get chased away. I was forced to get up to speed,
but not out of spike. 

Because of this, I never developed an online community. I never asked
a single question on Twitter. I was lucky enough to have those resources
in-person. Much of my development as an R user depended on these
people.

While I am grateful for all that I have had access to, I also know how
few people will have this opportunity. My path to learning R resembled
an apprenticeship, and one that only a handful will have access to.
