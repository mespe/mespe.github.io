I am a bit particular about keyboards. I find the keyboards on most
computers to be trash, whether it's a laptop or desktop. This has lead
to our house having 3 quality mechanical keyboards, despite having only one desktop
and one docking station (the odd one out, a classic 90's "clicky" keyboard, was politely banned from our
work space). This is also a reason I enjoy Lenovo laptops,
as they tend to have better keyboards than most.

However, the trend is ever continuing towards crappier and crappier
input devices in the name of thin, light, and stylish designs. The worst
offender has been the newer Apple products. After 15 minutes of borrowing a new model
Macbook, I was ready to throw the damn thing out the
window. 

So, when I started exploring my options to replacing my T460s (whose
keyboard I have never been wild about), I happened across many reviews
which raved about the keyboard of the T470. But phrases such as ["the 2mm
travel is satisfyingly
deep..."](http://www.notebookreview.com/notebookreview/lenovo-thinkpad-t470-review-business/)
stood out to me. Am I crazy, or is that
not actually much travel?

A quick search on that same site shows that the standard has shifted
rapidly: "[the depth of key travel is pretty shallow at only about 2mm](http://www.notebookreview.com/notebookreview/lenovo-thinkpad-t460s-review/)"
	
At most data science gatherings, you always see that one person
rocking a X200 or T60. I am starting to get it.
