I am an agronomist by training (dealing with all things agriculture),
with an emphasis in the yield of major crops. I am particularly
interested in the historic causes of yield variability to inform
efforts to feed our growing population with increasingly limited
resources.

But I wear many hats. I am also a data scientist, with a focus on
increasing capability of researchers to expand their capabilities. In
this role, I develop new tools and teach people existing tools and
data skillsets.

Currently, I am a Post-doc at UC Davis in the Dept. of Plant
Sciences and with the [Data Science Initiative](http://dsi.ucdavis.edu).
