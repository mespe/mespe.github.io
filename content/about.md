I am an agronomist (dealing with all things agriculture) by training,
with an emphasis on the drivers of the yield of major crops. I am
particularly interested in using the historic causes of yield
variability to inform efforts to provide food, fuel, and fiber for our
growing population sustainably. 

But I wear many hats. I am also a data scientist, with a focus on
increasing capability of researchers to expand what they can study. In
this role, I develop new tools (R packages, libraries, models) and
teach people how to effectively use existing tools and hone their data skills.

Currently, I am a Post-doc at UC Davis in the Dept. of Plant
Sciences and with the [Data Science Initiative](http://dsi.ucdavis.edu).
